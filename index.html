                <h2>#1 About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I hold a degree in law and my background in general is in business development with 20 years of experience. I worked for a well-known 
                    company in Estonia for a bit over 20 years, helping them to expand their business and grow. My main focus was developing their webshop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    20 years is a very long time to work for one company. I held various positions in that company which made it possible for me 
                    to grow in my job but at some point I felt I had reached the top and needed a career change. After a long consideration I decided to quit
                    my job in May 2020 and make a transition into a new career as a software developer.

                <h2>#2 The road to coding</h2>
                <p>
                    It was in 2018, when, by accident, I stumbled upon this free Estonian MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) on Python programming 
                    "Intro to Python"
                    and signed up. Already in the beginning of the course I was fascinated by 
                    what you can do with just a few lines of code. This sparked my interest! The course had 3 modules and in the end of 2019, 
                    after finishing the last module, I realized that this is something I need to explore in more detail and take my Python coding studies
                    even further.  
                </p>
                <p>   
                    After quitting my job in May 2020 I dedicated myself completely to studying programming. 
                    I had no idea where this new journey would take me but inside I felt that this was, indeed, 
                    the right decision.

                <h2>#3 Finding Treehouse</h2>
                <p>
                    There are tons of online learning platforms out there to choose from when it comes to programming. How do you pick the one 
                    that suits you the most? I did a lot of research on the web and I found <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" 
                    target="_blank">Treehouse</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    What I like the most is that they have a really clear structure to learning
                    different topics. All courses are highly interactive which means you'll have workshops, quizzes, practice sessions
                    and code challenges regularly following each lesson in a course.
                    You'll start building projects from day one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Either you wish to take just one quick course on a specific topic or complete an entire track or
                    sign up for a bootcamp-style <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree" target="_blank">
                    Techdegree</a> - the choice is yours and the options are pretty much limitless! They have a 7-day free trial as well 
                    so check it out - what have you got to lose? ðŸ˜Š

                <p>
                    So what are you waiting for? ðŸ˜Š Oh yes, before you head off to Treehouse, please do read about the
                    <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge in the next
                    chapter which I took with Treehouse. ðŸ‘‡
                </p>

                <h2>#4 The 100DaysOfCode challenge</h2>
                <p>
                   As I started my Python studies at Treehouse in May 2020 I noticed this banner when I logged in:
                </p>
                <p>
                   <img title="Treehouse's 100DaysOfCode banner" src="images/100DaysOfCode.png" alt="Image of the 100DaysOfCode add" class="responsive"">
                </p>
                <p>
                    It got my interest and I decided to find out more about it. Didn't take that long for me to hop on board and join the challenge! ðŸ˜Š
                    The basic idea is that you code for 100 days in a row and either tweet or use other social media sites to let others
                    know about your progress. Small breaks are allowed, of course. I went kind of crazy and literally coded for 100 days straight which I do 
                    not recommend. ðŸ¤¯
                </p>
                <p>    
                    I'm not the social media type and you can't find me on Facebook, Instagram etc... (yes, life is possible without
                    these sites ðŸ˜Š) but in order to participate in this challenge I made myself an account on Twitter and tagged Treehouse every day tweeting 
                    about my progress (sorry, Treehouse! ðŸ˜³).
                    On August 31st my challenge was completed and I received this acknowledgement from Treehouse:
                </p>
                <p>

                 </p>
                 <p>
                    My final thoughts and overall summary on the challenge can be found 
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ave-nurme_100daysofcode-python-codenewbie-activity-6706307776915804160-P2jK" target="_blank">
                    here</a>.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    P.S. I'm currently doing the 2nd round of the #100DaysOfCode - seriously! ðŸ˜Š But with plenty of breaks this time to avoid burning out and 
                    keep my mind fresh.
                 </p>

                 <h2>#5 Where am I now?</h2>
                 <p>
                     I have completed the Python track on Treehouse and in addition to that I have learned about so many other topics there. You
                     can check it <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/avenurme" target="_blank">here</a>.   
                     In mid November
                     I joined the Front End Web Development track and currently working on that. I wish to switch into the FEWD Techdegree at
                     some point in 2021 to get the full learning experience on Treehouse.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     ðŸ‘‰ It is really important to start building your own projects based on your new knowledge and take those training wheels off as soon as 
                     possible. You should also showcase your projects, no matter how small or big! I have done so and been able to catch the attention of
                      several technical recruiters via LinkedIn.
